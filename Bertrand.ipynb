    "# Price Competition\n",
    "Consider two companies competing on price. The goods (or services) the companies are providing are completely homogenous - they are completely identical. A good example of such a market is the market for economy airline tickets. Most consumers purchasing economy airline tickets is only interested in getting from A to B, and usually have no loyalty or preference in the choice of airline. As a consequence, we assume that the consumer will purchase whichever airline ticket is cheapest. This would typically lead to very low, if any, profit margins for airlines.\n",

    "The number of passengers on the route from Oslo Gardermoen and London Heathrow can be downloaded from Eurostat and the corresponding average ticket price can be found at TravelMarket's \"Norsk Flyprisindeks\"."
